# fem_1d_heat_conduction
A linear 1D heat conduction problem was solved using finite element method. FEM code was written in such a way that variable number of elements and linear or quadratic shape function can be used to solve the problem. A particular case given below is solved in the code, but values can be changed to solve any linear 1d heat conduction problem.
